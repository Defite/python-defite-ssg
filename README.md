## Yet another simple static site generator built with Python 3

Script parces `content` folder and build `/blog` and `blog/{path}/` pages.

## Install

1. `git clone` this repo and `cd` to the folder with project
2. check if [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) is installed, if not - you will need it
3. run `pipenv install`
4. after creating markdown content, run `python main.py` (or whatever alias for Python you have)
5. static files will be stored in `build` folder

**P.S.** This is WIP, stay tuned.
